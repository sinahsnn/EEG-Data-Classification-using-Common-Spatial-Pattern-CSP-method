# EEG-Data-Classification-using-Common-Spatial-Pattern-CSP-method
In this repository, the CSP algorithm was applied to classify the imagination of foot movement and mental subtraction tasks:
- using the training data, CSP filters were calculated( using the Rayleigh quotient maximization method)
- topo plots for the first and last obtained filters were plotted. 
- using SVM, the classification task was done.
